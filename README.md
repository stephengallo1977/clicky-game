Sopranos Clicky Game

Appication Overview:

In this application, I created a simple memory game with React. The goal here was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

Application Instructions:

This application renders a dozen different images from the Sopranos, to the screen.

Each time the user clicks on a Sopranos image, the images are shuffled. The goal for the user is to click on each image once and only once.

This application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on a Sopranos image for the first time in the current round, their correct guesses score is incremented

If the user clicks on an image they have already clicked on in the current round, their correct guesses score will reset to 0.

This application keeps track of the users best score, and updates it when the user achieves a new best score.
